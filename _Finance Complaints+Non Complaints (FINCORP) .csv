Economy,@CNBC @Grow_mag What a stupid advice… in one way you are only burning cash and the other one at least you are repaying principal and increase your wealth.

Economy,"@zwitscherhirsch @inside_r3 @CNBC But in this case I think that would be a mistake. Cash is declining is because of convenience (physical) and lack of online support, not because we don’t value censorship-resistance/privacy. But if we’re not careful we’ll only realise we’ve lost those things when it’s too late",0,Non-Complaint,negative,fear
Economy,"@zwitscherhirsch @inside_r3 @CNBC So maybe my point is that you can USUALLY trust ‘revealed preferences’. Simply IGNORE what people SAY they want and just look at what they actually do. And so if we all stop using cash, this tells us that it’s because we don’t really value cash and so it’s fine if it goes away.",0,Non-Complaint,positive,other
Economy,"@zwitscherhirsch @inside_r3 @CNBC And maybe this could lead to a dangerous place: we all benefit from cash’s unique properties but, because we individually stop using it for convenience/format reasons, we contribute to its demise! “You don’t know what you had until it’s gone.”",0,Non-Complaint,negative,fear
Economy,"@zwitscherhirsch @inside_r3 @CNBC By “decline to irrelevance” I was imagining a time when consumers stop using it because 1) physical alternatives (eg contactless) are more convenient, and 2) they do more commerce online. So we may *individually* stop using cash but NOT because we dislike its unique properties",0,Non-Complaint,positive,other
Economy,"@inside_r3 @CNBC @gendal However I find it questionable to say ""if physical cash begins to decline to irrelevance"", because (a) these words make people fear that digitalisation takes away their money and (b) the shape doesn't matter for its relevance as long as it's the same currency with the same value.",0,Non-Complaint,neutral,fear

Economy,"@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt The value of a home increases or decreases regardless of the cash you put into it.
